# 2017 Top3 Movie Market Comparison

## Introduction
I love watching movies, and I know that people have different tastes in movies because of their differences on culture backgrounds, characteristics and value systems. But how about on an aggregated level such as country? What are the most appreciated movies by people in different countries? Are there any differences? 

Movie Box Mojo is a website that provides up-to-date movie box office data around the world. It also has movie ranking list on domestic box office of most of major movie markets. By scraping movie data from this website and merging to the movie ranking list, we can have most of the movie summary data to do the analysis, such as genre, gross and budget.But for some foreign movies, the movie summary data are not available or complete in Movie Box Mojo's data.So I completed the missing data by integrating IMDB's movie summary, including missing genre information of some foreign movies and all the movie plots summary. The data used in this project can be found under 'Data' of this page, while the codes for scraping movie box mojo's movie info can be found under 'Codes'.

The study focus on movie markets of US/Canada, China and Japan, because the distribution of global movie box office is highly concentracting on these 3 markets which contributed more than 50% to global movie revenue.
